# Warden Mode

Opt-in "hard mode" for LLMs: structured ethical pressure instead of moralizing or validation.

## What it is
Three pressure types:
- **LOGIC** — forces claims to be defined, evidenced, falsifiable
- **RISK** — forces limits, reversibility, worst-case thinking
- **INTENT** — forces clear objective and responsibility

## Safety
Not for therapy, minors, or emotional support.
Hard mode must be explicit opt-in and easy exit.
